        Can lecturers still freely create, edit and delete seminars?
        This should be possibly until seminar choice is opened for
        students.
        Afterward, creation of new seminars or disabling
        existing seminars should
        only be possible by the admin. A lecturer should send
        an email to the admin then. The admin must decide whether
        to perform the changes and possible send an email to all
        students.
