# Matching Results for `r semester` round `r round`

- We have `r num.studs` students and `r num.sems` seminars.

- `r num.match` of `r total.slots` seminar slots have been filled (`r round(100*num.match / total.slots)`%) and `r num.empty` students (`r round(100*num.empty / num.studs)`%) did not get assigned a seminar.

- On average a student listed `r round(mean(df$num_ranked),1)` seminars in the preference list.

The following table shows for Bachelor and Master students, how many students found or found not a seminar.
```{r }
sdf = df %>%
  group_by(studBAMA,found) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  spread(key = found, value=n) %>%
  as.data.frame()

sdf$total = sdf[,2]+sdf[,3]
sdf
```

Here are the shares of students that got the seminar that they ranked at n'th position... 

```{r }
df %>% 
  mutate(N=n()) %>%
  group_by(studBAMA,pos, found) %>% 
  summarise(share = paste0(round(100*n() / first(N),1),"%")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pos = paste0("Ranked ",pos)) %>%
  dcast(pos ~ studBAMA+found, value.var="share")
```

In an ideal world for students, every student gets his first ranked seminar. The rows where found equals `no seminar` describe the share of students who did not get a seminar and have ranked one seminar less than the rank column (i.e. the option `no seminar` is ranked as the rank column indicates). If students have ranked only very few seminars it may not be surprising that they did not get a seminar. It is not so good if students who have ranked a lot of seminars still do not get a seminar.

And now we show how the length of a students' preference lists relates with the share of students that got assigned a seminar:
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(studBAMA,num_ranked) %>% 
  mutate(N=n()) %>%
  group_by(studBAMA,num_ranked, found) %>% 
  summarise(share = paste0(round(100*n() / first(N),1),"%")) %>%
  dcast(num_ranked ~ studBAMA + found,value.var="share")
```

Let us now compare for Bachelor students the seminar matching by their main subject:

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(studBAMA=="Bachelor") %>% 
  group_by(studSubject, found) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  dcast(studSubject ~ found,value.var="n") %>%
  arrange(-`found seminar`)
```

and the same thing for master students...
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(studBAMA=="Master") %>% 
  group_by(studSubject, found) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  dcast(studSubject ~ found,value.var="n") %>%
  arrange(-`found seminar`)
```
